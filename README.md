Sickle is a mod for Scythe Digital Edition to improve the performance of the AI

# How to use (Steam)
1. Take a backup of file: C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Scythe Digital Edition\Scythe_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll and move it elsewhere
2. Download the Assembly-CSharp.dll from the main branch and save it to C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Scythe Digital Edition\Scythe_Data\Managed
3. Run a game (be sure to use the "Hard" AI, I am not making changes to the Easy/Medium AI)

I don't know if this AI will work with multiplayer; if it does, then it is probably the host's version of the AI that runs. Or, it may crash the game. Submit an Issue if the game crashes.

# Not Steam?
The file is *probably* the same, and goes to the same path ...\Scythe_Data\Managed\Assembly-CSharp.dll

# Mobile
Sorry, you're out of luck. Maybe the official developer will implement these changes into an official update! That would be welcome.
